This project is a lightweight Discord bot that listens to specific channels across multiple servers and relays messages to corresponding webhook URLs stored in Google Firestore. It's designed to power internal automations using n8n by triggering workflows based on Discord chat activity.

Messages are parsed in real time and forwarded to the correct webhook based on the guild and channel, enabling flexible, server-specific automation logic.

This bot is not intended for public use or distribution.
